**Subject:** Free API for Fact-Checking Teams – Factyne Beta

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because your team is doing important work in fact-checking, and I think Factyne can help you move faster.

**Factyne** is an API that automatically extracts and scores claims from articles in seconds. Your team could use it to:

✅ Speed up article analysis (find claims in seconds, not minutes)  
✅ Process more articles (scale your operations)  
✅ Standardize extraction (consistent claim format)  

**The API:**
- Extracts specific claims with confidence scores
- Calculates overall trust scores  
- Detects contradictions between claims
- **Free tier**: 1,000 requests/month
- **Paid tiers**: Rs.99-Rs.499/month for scale

**Quick stats from testing:**
- Extracts 2-3 claims per article (average)
- Trust scores range 0.65-0.78 for mixed content
- Response time: <100ms per request

Would you be open to a 20-min call to see if this fits your workflow? I'd love to get your feedback as we build out the product.

Best,  
Nayan Agarwal
